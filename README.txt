Total ratio R/K calculation

Calculates the net charge of stretches of 30 amino acids, counts the total number of arginines (R) and lysines (K) and calculates the ratio R/K. The input is a uniprot.fasta archive and the output contains the net charge and its respective values of R, K found and R/K calculated. Example:

Charge: 0	R: 2173	K: 2113	R/K: 1.028395646
Charge: 1	R: 1563	K: 1656	R/K: 0.94384057971
Charge: 2	R: 1226	K: 1132	R/K: 1.08303886926
Charge: 3	R: 547	K: 475	R/K: 1.15157894737
Charge: 4	R: 200	K: 195	R/K: 1.02564102564
Charge: 5	R: 158	K: 144	R/K: 1.09722222222

The range of the net charge that this algorithm evaluates is from 0 to 30.
